# DiscordBot
A Discord bot that you can use using your own discord bot token. A lot of stuff here is just plain fun that I had with friends while testing so the options are endless.

<h3>How to set it up:</h3>
The program uses your Discord bot token. So if you have not already, make a Discord bot in the Discord developer site and get your bot token.

1) Download Python version 3+.
2) Download the python source code.
3) Go to windows settings.
4) Go to the about section.
5) Go to Advance Settings.
6) Go to Environment Variables.
7) Make the variable Discord_Bot_Token and set the value to your Discord bot token
8) Test it out if it works.

Look at the code and I recommend looking into some tutorials on how to code a bot since a lot of this wont make sense right away by just looking at the code.
